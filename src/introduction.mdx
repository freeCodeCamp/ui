# freeCodeCamp's UI Component Library

Welcome to freeCodeCamp's UI component library. This is a collection of reusable
components that can be used to build user interfaces for freeCodeCamp projects.

## Installation

- Run the following command to install the library:

```bash
pnpm install @freecodecamp/ui
```

- Import the library's base stylesheet in your app, then import your app CSS after so the library's defaults can be overridden:

```tsx
// app.tsx
import "@freecodecamp/ui/dist/base.css";
import "./my-app.css";
```

- Use the `getThemingClass` util to get a CSS class for theming, and add the class to the `body` element:

```tsx
import { getThemingClass } from "@freecodecamp/ui";

const MyApp = () => {
	const cls = getThemingClass();

	return <body className={cls}></body>;
};
```
