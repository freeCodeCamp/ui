freeCodeCamp's component library is a collection of reusable React components that can be used in your projects. The components are built with accessibility in mind and are designed to be easy to use and customize.

## Installation

- Run the following command to install the library:

```bash
pnpm install @freecodecamp/ui
```

- Import the library's base stylesheet into your app:

```tsx
// app.tsx
import '@freecodecamp/ui/dist/base.css';
import './my-app.css'; // Your custom stylesheet should be imported after, in order to override the base.
```

- Add either the `light-palette` or `dark-palette` class to the `body` element to enable theming:

```html
<body class="light-palette"></body>
```
